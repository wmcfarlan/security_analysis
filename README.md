# Global Terrorism Analysis
<br><br>

Analyzing trends, insights, and understanding the interaction between female education and terrorism.

__Abstract:__
I collected all known global acts of terrorism from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism from the years between 1970 and 2018. This data was analysed to find trends and insight. I have combined this data with global education data to further my analysis. My primary question: does the education of women affect number of terrorist events in a given country?

# Background & Motivation
Terrorism is a constant security threat around the world. With more insight into how terrorism works, governments can make better decisions in dealing with present threats. While typical approaches to terrorism involve target hardening and military intervention, I wondered what role education played education. Spesifically, the role of educating females.

My background is in psychotherapy, so I often look to more humanitarian based interventions to global conflict. If we can put a higher evaluation on education and get an outcome of lower terrorism, this would be a desireable approach.

## Insights into Terrorism
In order to trend terrorism, I focused on events after 9/11. The Twin Tower terrorist attack was a moment of global change.
